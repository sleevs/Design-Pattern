# Design-Pattern

Esse repositório tem como objetivo dar apoio a pesquisas em engenharia de software e manter um fluxo contínuo 
de trabalhos de maneira que possa amadurecer a compreensão sobre padrões de projetos e arquitetura de aplicações .

This repository aims to support research in software engineering and maintain a continuous flow of work in order 
to mature the understanding of design patterns and application architecture.



### Creational patterns

  -  Factory : This pattern define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Allow a class to defer the actual instantiation to subclass.
     
     [In this example a framework was implemented to custumize the exception handling that occurs in the application](https://github.com/sleevs/Design-Pattern/blob/master/creational/FactoryMethod.cpp)
  
  -  Abstract factory : This pattern  provides an interface for creating families of related or dependet objects without 
     specifying the concrete classes.
  
     [The example is a framework for a GUI environment where windows will be drawn on different operating systems.
     Each OS will have a dedicated factory for creating graphic abstractions.](https://github.com/sleevs/Design-Pattern/blob/master/creational/AbstractFactory.cpp)
  
  -  Builder : This pattern separetes construction of complex object from its representation so that construction process can create different representation.
     
     [The example is a notification application which defines several ways to notify](https://github.com/sleevs/Design-Pattern/blob/master/creational/BuilderPattern.cpp)
